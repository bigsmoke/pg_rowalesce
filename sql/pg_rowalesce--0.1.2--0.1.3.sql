    on function pg_rowalesce_meta_pgxn()
    is $markdown$
Returns the JSON meta data that has to go into the `META.json` file needed for
[PGXNâ€”PostgreSQL Extension Network](https://pgxn.org/) packages.

The `Makefile` includes a recipe to allow the developer to: `make META.json` to
refresh the meta file with the function's current output, including the
`default_version`.

`pg_rowalesce` can be found on PGXN: https://pgxn.org/dist/pg_readme/
